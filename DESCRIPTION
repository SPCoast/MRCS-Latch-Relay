First line: This board has a relay and supporting components and implements a latch circuit for alerting operators to call the Dispatcher as part of
a model railroad telephone system, typical applications include:
•	Lighting an indicator (a limiting resistor is provided for LEDs, but a 12V light bulb can be substituted) after a station is initially called (buzzed): the indicator will remain lit until the associated phone is picked up.  This allows for an unmanned location to be called or can be used at a manned location where the operator may be busy with another task and might forget to call back.
•	Lighting an indicator at the Dispatcher’s desk indicating that a call request has been made but not answered
Features:
•	12 VDC operation
•	Option of on-board power from a wall wart via 2.1mm plug or screw terminals for use with 12V layout auxiliary power bus.
•	Latch is held in series with a normally closed contact from the associated phone or with our “Off-Hook Detector”
•	Current limiting resistor (normally 1K ohm) for LED indicator on board
•	Jumper to select 12V or ground for LED/Lamp supply
•	Extra +12V and GND connections for easy daisy chaining and connections to phones
•	Compact (1.2” x 2”) footprint allows the relay latch to be placed inside standard phones, close by our Cup Hook Phone or placed at a central location close to the Dispatcher


Remaining lines: a verbose changelog of what makes this "git version" different from the last.
Use this space (in Markdown format) to describe the context and details of the changes.
This section should be 5 to 20 lines of interesting detail; each version tab in the project will 
display this text to help the reader understand why this version is differnet...

The published project on the SPCoast.github.io website will
include the relevant git commit messages as a terse, high level
changelog, so don't replicate those messages here.
