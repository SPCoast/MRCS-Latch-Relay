This board has a relay and supporting components and implements a latch circuit for alerting operators to call the Dispatcher as part of
a model railroad telephone system, typical applications include:
•	Lighting an indicator (a limiting resistor is provided for LEDs, but a 12V light bulb can be substituted) after a station is initially called (buzzed): the indicator will remain lit until the associated phone is picked up.  This allows for an unmanned location to be called or can be used at a manned location where the operator may be busy with another task and might forget to call back.
•	Lighting an indicator at the Dispatcher’s desk indicating that a call request has been made but not answered
Features:
•	12 VDC operation
•	Option of on-board power from a wall wart via 2.1mm plug or screw terminals for use with 12V layout auxiliary power bus.
•	Latch is held in series with a normally closed contact from the associated phone or with our “Off-Hook Detector”
•	Current limiting resistor (normally 1K ohm) for LED indicator on board
•	Jumper to select 12V or ground for LED/Lamp supply
•	Extra +12V and GND connections for easy daisy chaining and connections to phones
•	Compact (1.2” x 2”) footprint allows the relay latch to be placed inside standard phones, close by our Cup Hook Phone or placed at a central location close to the Dispatcher
